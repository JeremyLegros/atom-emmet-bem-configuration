# emmetConfig
  How to configure Atom emmet package for extensions, such as defining the filter |bem always active
## Short story
  The procedure implied in the readme is really confusing and incomplete.
  Needed to read the END of the readme + doc https://docs.emmet.io/customization/ .<br/>
  You have to create choose the location and the name of the files you want yourself. <br/>
  This repo contains all the needed files with my preferences, modify them at your need.<br/>
  The preferences are split in three files "preferences.json", "snippets.json", "syntaxProfiles.json"
### Procedure
  Place the emmetConfig folder somewhere meaningful, something like  "&#126;/.atom/" or "&#126;/.atom/packages/emmet/" etc..<br/>
  go to the Atom > Settings > packages > emmet > settings > Extension path <br/>
  set the path corresponding to the location of your emmetConfig folder <br/>
  Relaunch atom.
