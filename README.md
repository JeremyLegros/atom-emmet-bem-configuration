## Short story
  The procedure implied in the readme is really confusing and incomplete.
  Needed to read the <bold> end </bold> of the readme + doc https://docs.emmet.io/customization/
  You have to create choose the location and the name of the files you want yourself.
  This repo contains all the needed files with my preferences, modify them at your need.
  The preferences are split in three files "preferences.json", "snippets.json", "syntaxProfiles.json"
### procedure
  Place the emmetConfig folder somewhere meaningful, something like "~/.atom/" or "~/.atom/packages/emmet/" etc..
  go to the Atom > Settings > packages > emmet > settings > Extension path
  set the path corresponding to the location of your emmetConfig folder
  Relaunch atom.
